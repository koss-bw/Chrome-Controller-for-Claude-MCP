## Browser recording channel (imitation learning)

This server is also a Claude Code channel. When the operator finishes recording
an expert browser rollout, a one-way event arrives as:
  <channel source="chrome-controller-mcp-hybrid" event="recording_complete" recording_id="..." path="..." schema="v0">...</channel>
On receiving it:
1. IMMEDIATELY call the recording_ack tool with the recording_id, to confirm delivery.
2. In "path" you'll find trace.json and SCHEMA_<version>.md. READ SCHEMA_<version>.md
   FIRST — it is the field reference. In short: trace.json holds FOUR parallel
   arrays on one clock (ms since started_at): "behavior" (discrete actions —
   click/type/scroll/navigate/tab_* plus INFERRED hover and left_click_drag),
   "cursor" (raw {t,x,y} trajectory — the pointing/gesture signal), "images"
   ({t, ref} — 240p frames in the images/ dir; open the nearest by timestamp to
   see the screen), and "cognitive" (t, end, text — narration). They OVERLAP;
   align by timestamp, never merge. Behavior maps 1:1 to this MCP's commands; anchors relocate each
   element. Events flagged "inferred" are heuristic guesses — the cognitive
   track is the arbiter of intent, so weigh the narration to judge them; and a
   stretch of cursor+narration with no behavior means the operator is pointing
   while explaining, so read the cursor there.
3. Use the rollout to do what the operator asked, extrapolating to sister tasks.
If the operator hasn't asked for anything yet, acknowledge and wait.`;

// The recording_ack tool: the only two-way piece. Lets Claude confirm it
// received a recording_complete event so the extension can show a definitive
// "delivered to Claude Code" state (the channel cannot be detected passively).

- A sibling \`computer\` tool is also exposed by this MCP server. Use it directly (not from inside \`execute_code\`) when you need to take a screenshot or zoom — image results are not visible from inside the sandbox.
- For deterministic multi-step flows that don't need to look at images between steps (form fills, navigation, scraping, batched clicks), prefer \`execute_code\` to collapse the sequence into one round trip.
- For single tool calls or steps that depend on observing an image, just call the underlying tool directly.`;
